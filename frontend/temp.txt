Failed to compile.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './views/NativeStackView' in '/home/raison/git/Aruco-marks-DB-system/frontend/node_modules/@react-navigation/native-stack/lib/module'
Did you mean 'NativeStackView.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request './views/NativeStackView' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
